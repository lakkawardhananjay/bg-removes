## **Deployment to Google Cloud**

This project uses **Google Cloud Artifact Registry** and **Cloud Run** for deployment. Follow the steps below for production deployment:

### **Pre-requisites**

1. Google Cloud project with the following services enabled:
   - Artifact Registry
   - Cloud Run

2. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud auth configure-docker [REGION]
   ```

### **Steps for Deployment**

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Tag and push the image to **Artifact Registry**:
   ```bash
   docker tag <IMAGE_ID> gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/background-removal:latest
   docker push gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/background-removal:latest
   ```

   Replace:
   - `<IMAGE_ID>`: Docker image ID from `docker images`.
   - `[PROJECT_ID]`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.

3. Deploy the application to **Cloud Run**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy background-removal \
     --image gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/background-removal:latest \
     --platform managed \
     --region [REGION] \
     --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

   Replace:
   - `[PROJECT_ID]`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.
   - `[REGION]`: Your preferred Google Cloud region (e.g., `us-central1`).

4. After successful deployment, note the service URL provided by Cloud Run. Use this URL to access the API.
